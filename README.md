# Example-2D-Platformer
*This is an example platformer I made for other's to use and plan to post it to godot's asset library!*

## My comments
*Yeah it's unfinished as of now.*
*I started piling up other project's so now this is in the dumpster by now.*
*You can always help make it better. But it's your own choice.*

*I plan to come back later and finish it but I'm kinda busy lately.*



### What does it have:
 1. A platform character
 2. A few enemys
 3. 2 levels
 4. A menu
